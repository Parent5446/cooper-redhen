
This is the visible part of the site. It uses HTML for display, and Javascript to alter the HTML and communicate with the server (frontend.py).


index.html: Main page, javascript and html

file_upload_frame.html: Separate frame used for file uploads; a frame is necessary since otherwise loading a file would refresh the whole page.

main.css: style definitions for the other pages
